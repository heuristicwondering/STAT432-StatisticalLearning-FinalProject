# Final Project for STAT 432, Statistical Learning
This is the code base for the term project for the statistical learning class taught at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign

**Team: ** Fantastic Four
**Members: ** Megan Finnegan (*team contact*); Krishna Anapindi; Do Hyun Hwang; Rohan Dalmia

*The content of this project is exploring the clustering accuracy of k-means applied to short time window correlation matrices in fMRI task-based paradigms. k-means is an approach widely used in dynamic connectivity, however it is currently unknown if connectivity matrices are well suited for this approach. Test accuracy is reported for k-means and the performance of alternate classification methods compared. For a summary of the work contained herein, please read the project proposal and the final report pdf's.*

Note that the results of this project are preliminary and several more nuanced considerations have not been implemented given the limited scope and time frame of the class. Although this code is made publicly available it is not intended in any way to make definitive recommendations for classification algorithms or parameters, but merely to suggest future directions.

We request that any derivations of our approach to please cite this repository.

## Running Code
Currently this code has not been integrated into a single point of entry. This is considered a to-do for any future work on this project. Data is broadly group however into MATLAB based preprocessing and R analysis code folders.

The data used in the project is available upon request and from approval of the Principle Investigator for the original data (Dr. Heidemarie Laurent).

A summary of the results included in the reports folder and is submitted for grading in this class.
