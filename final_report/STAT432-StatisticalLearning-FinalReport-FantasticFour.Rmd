2. What is functional connectivity and what is the evidence that it is contains coginitive content

3. What is dynamic functional connectivity. Why is it important.

4. What are some of the common parameters/approaches used in dc-fMRI. Why are these assumptions prolematic

5. How do we plan to assess the suitablity of these parameters

# Methods

1. Describe the data set

2. Describe the preprocessing

3. Describe the connectivity matrix creation

4. Describe the analysis

# Results
TBD

# Discussion?
